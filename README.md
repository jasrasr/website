# Website Stuff
This is where I will dump HTML/CSS/JS scripts. I started my own website back in 2004 and have created a ton of code. It is all somewhere on my website. I currently use hostinger but have used GoDaddy (billable through LuckyRegister) and Powweb before that. I currently maintain several domains but really only publish on [https://jasonlamb.me](https://jasonlamb.me). I like to use [https://jasr.me](https://jasr.me) for three things right now.

   1.1 Fork of [github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS)
