# Website Stuff
This is where I will dump HTML/CSS/JS scripts. I started my own website back in 2004 and have created a ton of code. It is all somewhere on my website. I currently use hostinger but have used GoDaddy (billable through LuckyRegister) and Powweb before that. I currently maintain several domains but really only publish on [https://jasonlamb.me](https://jasonlamb.me). I like to use [https://jasr.me](https://jasr.me) for three things right now.
1. link shortener and tracker [jasr.me](https://jasr.me)
2. secure text sender [jasr.me/secure](https://jasr.me/secure)
3. random password generator [jasr.me/pw](https://jasr.me/pw)
